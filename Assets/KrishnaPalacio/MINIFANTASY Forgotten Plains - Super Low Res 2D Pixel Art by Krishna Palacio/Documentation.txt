Rule and Animated Tiles
	The Scenes labeled with "(Rule + Animated Tiles)" scene makes use of Rule and Animated Tiles.
	In order to show the scene properly and make use of these Tiles, you will need to have downloaded and imported the 2D Tilemap Extras package.
	If you are using a Unity Version 2020 or older, you will need to enable preview packages in "Package Manager > Advanced Project Settings > Enable Preview Packages."
	If you are using a Unity Version 2021 or newer, the package should appear in the Unity Registry as a standard package.

	When using the Rule Tiles, they will generally appear red when the tile is considered incomplete.
	You may change these settings by opening the Rule Tile object in "Tile Palettes > Rule Tiles."

Random Brush
	In order to place tiles randomly we recommend using the random brushes included in the 2D Tilemap Extras package.
	For Unity versions 2021 and above: Link here https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.2d.tilemap.extras@2.0/manual/index.html
	For Unity versions 2020 and below: Link here https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.2d.tilemap.extras@1.6/manual/index.html

Sorting Layer Setup
	All objects are on the default layer. The objects are grouped as follows:
	-10	Ground
	-9	Water	
	-8	Ground Decoration, Water Decoration
	-7	Ground Shadow, Prop Shadows				Defined as: shadows that rest on the ground.
	-6	Walls - Vertical
	-5	Walls - Horizontal
	-4	Walls - Cliffs (1)
	-3	Walls - Cliffs (2)
	-2	Walls - Cliffs (3)
	-1	Walls - Above Cliffs, Walls Shadow		Defined as: shadows that rest on walls.
	 0	Props

Placing Objects in the Scene
	We recommend one of these two options for maintaining crisp pixels while moving objects around the scene:
		1. Grid Snapping
			Set Size = 0.125 (1 pixel)
			You can change this setting in "Edit > Grid and Snap Settings > World Grid > Size."
		2. Grid and Snap Increment Snap
			Set Move = 0.125 (1 pixel) or 0.0625 (1/2 pixel)
			You can change this setting in "Edit > Grid and Snap Settings > Increment Snap > Move."
			Then hold ctrl while moving objects to increment their position based on the move setting.

Tile Palettes
	Tile Palettes are notated with FP for Forgotten Plains. 
	This is to avoid conflicts when multiple Minifantasy packs are imported in a single project.

Prop Variants
	Each type of prop comes with a script to easily change between prop variants.
	To change between prop variants, find the FP "Prop" Script component on a prop prefab and use the selection dropdown.
